\title{Generate Lollipop Plots by Complex}
\usage{
plot_lolipop(data, varname, path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing the following elements:
- `data.req`: A data frame with observation data. Must include columns `name`,
  `value`, and a density column named following the pattern `<varname>.den`
  (e.g., `"endophagy.den"`).
- `species_complex`: A data frame linking species names to their corresponding
  higher-level complexes, with columns `species` and `complex`.}

\item{varname}{A character string indicating the base name of the behavioral
variable to plot (e.g., `"endophagy"`, `"parous_rate"`). The corresponding
density column must be present in `data$data.req`.}

\item{path}{Optional. A character string giving the file path where the final
combined PNG plot should be saved. If `NULL`, the plot is not saved.}
}
\value{
A combined `ggplot` object containing one lollipop density plot per
species complex, aligned vertically and annotated with appropriate axis and
variable labels.
}
\description{
Creates a set of lollipop-style density plots showing the distribution of a specified
bionomics variable (e.g., endophagy, endophily, parous rate) across mosquito species,
grouped by higher-level species complexes. Each complex is displayed as a separate
subplot with consistent scaling and color mapping. Optionally saves the final
combined plot as a PNG file.
}
\details{
- Species names prefixed with `"unlabeled"` are cleaned before plotting.
- Species are matched to colors from a palette file named
  `"new_palette_density_plots.csv"`. Species missing from the palette are
  automatically assigned a default grey color.
- The resulting plots are combined and annotated using **cowplot**.
- If `path` is provided, the function saves the figure as a high-resolution PNG.
