\title{Estimate Species-Specific Bionomic Traits for Anopheles Using a Hierarchical Bayesian Framework}
\usage{
Bionomics_For_AnopholesModel()
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing bionomic estimates for each species, species complex,
or genus, with the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{species_name}{Name of the species, complex, or genus (e.g., \code{"Anopheles gambiae"},
      \code{"Gambiae complex"}, \code{"GENUS"}).}
    \item{M, M.sd}{Parous rate and its standard deviation.}
    \item{endophagy, endophagy.sd}{Endophagy level and its standard deviation.}
    \item{endophily, endophily.sd}{Endophily level and its standard deviation.}
    \item{A0, A0.sd}{Sac rate and its standard deviation.}
    \item{Chi}{Overall human blood index (HBI), derived from indoor and outdoor components.}
    \item{tau, tau.sd}{Resting duration and its standard deviation.}
  }
}
\description{
This function estimates key bionomic traits of *Anopheles* mosquitoes using a set of
hierarchical Bayesian models fitted independently for each trait across three taxonomic
levels: genus, species complex, and species. The estimated traits include parous rate,
endophagy, endophily, sac rate, indoor and outdoor human blood indices, and resting duration.
}
\details{
For human blood feeding behaviour, indoor and outdoor human blood indices are first estimated
separately. The overall human blood index (HBI, denoted \code{Chi}) is then derived a posteriori
as a deterministic function of endophagy:
\deqn{
  Chi = indoor\_HBI \times endophagy + outdoor\_HBI \times (1 - endophagy)
}
Indoor and outdoor HBI estimates are not returned in the final output.

Resting duration is estimated by the model and returned as the parameter \code{tau},
preserving compatibility with downstream transmission models.

Internally, the function relies on \code{creation_df()} to format input data for each trait and
\code{run_stan()} to perform Bayesian inference using Stan. Posterior summaries are aggregated
across taxonomic levels using an internal helper function, and missing species or complexes are
imputed using information from higher taxonomic levels when necessary.


Missing species-level estimates are imputed using available information at the species-complex
or genus level, following a predefined taxonomic compatibility table. Species and complex names
are normalised (e.g., mapping \code{"Anopheles gambiae s.s. / Colluzi"} to
\code{"Anopheles gambiae"}, and genus-level estimates are labelled as \code{"GENUS"}).
A synthetic \code{"Jamesii complex"} row is added based on genus-level estimates to ensure
completeness of the output.
}
\note{
This function assumes that \code{creation_df()} and \code{run_stan()} are available in the
environment and return appropriately formatted data and fitted Stan model objects.
