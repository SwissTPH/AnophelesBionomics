\title{Generate a Pie Chart of Observations by Species or Complex}
\usage{
obs_complex_species_pie(data, threshold_prop_other = 0.05, plot_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing the following named elements:
- `data.req`: A data frame with observation data. Must contain a column named
  after the pattern `"<varname>.den"` (e.g., `"psrous_rate.den"`), which stores
  the observation counts per species.
- `varname`: A character string indicating the base name of the observation variable
  (used to identify the column `<varname>.den` in the data).
- `nice_varname`: A character string used for naming the saved output file.}

\item{threshold_prop_other}{A numeric threshold (between 0 and 1) indicating the
minimum proportion of total observations required for a species or complex to appear
as its own slice in the pie chart. Species below this threshold are grouped under "Other".
Default is `0.05` (1%).}

\item{plot_dir}{Optional. A character string giving the directory path where
the HTML version of the pie chart should be saved. If `NULL`, the chart is not saved.
Default is a specific folder on the user's system.}
}
\value{
An interactive pie chart (`plotly` object) showing the distribution of
observations by species or species complex. If `plot_dir` is provided, the chart is also
saved as an HTML file.
}
\description{
This function creates an interactive pie chart that shows the distribution
of observations by species or species complexes, based on a specified
observation variable from a pre-processed dataset. It optionally groups
species with a small proportion of observations into a single "Other" category,
and can save the plot as an HTML file for sharing or embedding.
}
\details{
- Species names starting with `"unlabel_"` are treated as complexes and labeled accordingly.
- The observation variable used in the calculation must match the pattern `<varname>.den`.
- The pie chart uses `plotly` for interactive visualization and `htmlwidgets` to export.
