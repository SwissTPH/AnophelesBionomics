\title{Estimate Species-Specific Bionomic Traits for Anopheles Using a Hierarchical Bayesian Model}
\usage{
Bionomics_For_Anophles_Model()
}
\value{
A `data.frame` containing bionomic estimates for each species or complex, with the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{species_name}{Name of the species, complex, or genus (e.g., `"Anopheles gambiae"`, `"Gambiae complex"`, `"GENUS"`).}
    \item{M, M.sd}{Parous rate and its standard deviation.}
    \item{endophagy, endophagy.sd}{Endophagy level and its standard deviation.}
    \item{endophily, endophily.sd}{Endophily level and its standard deviation.}
    \item{A0, A0.sd}{Sac rate and its standard deviation.}
    \item{Chi}{Human blood index (HBI)}
  }
}
\description{
This function estimates various bionomic parameters (e.g., parous rate, endophagy, endophily,
sac rate, and human blood index) for Anopheles mosquitoes at three taxonomic levels: genus,
species complex, and species. It fits a hierarchical Bayesian model for each trait using Stan,
and merges the results into a single tidy data frame.
}
\details{
Internally, it calls `creation_df()` to prepare input data for each trait, and `run_stan()` to
perform Bayesian inference using Stan. The posterior summaries are processed by an internal function
to aggregate results across levels and to impute missing species based on known complexes or genus-level data.


The function handles missing data by imputing estimates based on available data at the complex or genus level.
It also performs name normalization (e.g., mapping `"Anopheles gambiae s.s."` to `"Anopheles gambiae"` and
`"Anopheles gambiae"` to `"Gambiae complex"`). A synthetic `"Jamesii complex"` row is added based on genus-level data.

A side-effect is the use of `print()` statements during model fitting to indicate progress.
}
\note{
This function assumes that `creation_df()` and `run_stan()` are defined in the environment and return appropriately
formatted data and model results.
